# Potential-for-synergistic-pesticide-effects
Here we use model arable communities of pests (aphids and weevils), predators (e.g. beetles, spiders and mites) and soil biota (including mites, earthworms and Enchytraeids) to understand synergistic impacts of insecticides (cypermethrin) interacting with the fungicides Azoxystrobin and Prochloraz.
